# An ontology for units of measures across history, standards, and scientific and technology domains

## Introducing... 

...an ontology that specifically targets challenges for handling units across databases of computational and experimental data from various sources. 
The resulting ontology allows addressing data integration challenges encountered in that effort, including: 

1. Referencing both specific and more general instances of units that have changed over time.
2. The use of unit systems to define short domain-relevant identifiers for a collection of units that make sense within a specific subdomain, rather than having to adopt globally standardized naming schemes. 
3. Specifications of relationships between units that enables tools to convert between them.
4. Units not part of the International System of Units (SI) can be represented without defining them in SI units or using SI system conventions.
